            <div class="abst">
                The goal of this project was to understand the underlying trends and patterns between strike calls made outside of the strike
                zone and factors out of the hands of the players. We examined these missed calls based on time of day, time
                of year, the inning it took place in as well as which half it was. Looking at all of this data we felt it
                was best to normalize it based on the number of pitches occuring to get a sense of the overall frequency
                with which these calls were being made.

                <em>The results of the project will go here...... <strong>Also, maybe we should break up the abstract with our plots</strong> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

                Moving forward, we would like to both expand the list of variables we are looking at, such as taking a look to see if home
                field advantage plays in, and which stadiums have the biggest impact, if any, on umpire calls. Additionally,
                we would like to create profiles for each umpire in the league and which factors have the biggest impacts
                on their calls. A stretch goal we have set for ourselves is to figure out if these missed calls have a relationship
                with the outcome of the play. Do players who have these missed calls against them strike out more often?
                Finally we would like to examine a few case studies of players to determine if there are any players playing
                consistently who encounter many or few of these calls.
